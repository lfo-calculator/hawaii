(1)
    (a) Whenever an air bag that is part of a previously deployed inflatable restraint system is replaced by either a new air bag that is part of an inflatable restraint system or a nondeployed salvage air bag that is part of an inflatable restraint system, the air bag must conform to the original equipment manufacturer requirements and the installer must verify that the self-diagnostic system for the inflatable restraint system indicates that the entire inflatable restraint system is operating properly.
    (b) A person in violation of this subsection (1) is guilty of a class C felony if the violation caused bodily injury as defined in RCW 9A.04.110 or death to another person.
    (c) A person in violation of this subsection (1) is guilty of a class C felony, regardless if the violation caused harm to another.
(2)

This subsection does not apply to nondeployed salvage air bags that meet the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.
    (b) A person in violation of this subsection (2) is guilty of a class C felony if the violation caused bodily injury as defined in RCW 9A.04.110 or death to another person.
    (c) A person in violation of this subsection (2) is guilty of a class C felony, regardless if the violation caused harm to another.

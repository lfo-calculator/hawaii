(1) A natural person who has a disability that meets one of the following criteria may apply for special parking privileges:
    (a) Cannot walk two hundred feet without stopping to rest;
    (b) Is severely limited in ability to walk due to arthritic, neurological, or orthopedic condition;
    (c) Has such a severe disability that the person cannot walk without the use of or assistance from a brace, cane, another person, prosthetic device, wheelchair, or other assistive device;
    (d) Uses portable oxygen;
    (e) Is restricted by lung disease to an extent that forced expiratory respiratory volume, when measured by spirometry, is less than one liter per second or the arterial oxygen tension is less than sixty mm/hg on room air at rest;
    (f) Impairment by cardiovascular disease or cardiac condition to the extent that the person's functional limitations are classified as class III or IV under standards accepted by the American heart association;
    (g) Has a disability resulting from an acute sensitivity to automobile emissions that limits or impairs the ability to walk. The personal physician, advanced registered nurse practitioner, or physician assistant of the applicant shall document that the disability is comparable in severity to the others listed in this subsection;
    (h) Has limited mobility and has no vision or whose vision with corrective lenses is so limited that the person requires alternative methods or skills to do efficiently those things that are ordinarily done with sight by persons with normal vision;
    (i) Has an eye condition of a progressive nature that may lead to blindness; or
    (j) Is restricted by a form of porphyria to the extent that the applicant would significantly benefit from a decrease in exposure to light.
(2) The disability must be determined by either:
    (a) A licensed physician;
    (b) An advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW; or
